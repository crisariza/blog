        Hi, I'm Sir Danny! Just like you, I have multiple goals that I'm working
        on :p
        <br /> <br />
        At the moment, I am not currently building anything. I'm working at a
        multinational company, earning approximately $700/month in Argentine
        Pesos, and going to college 5x a week.
        <br /> <br />
        Let me tell you about some things I want to achieve in the near future:
        launching a product or service, graduating from college, traveling the
        world, increasing my income, and many more.
      </p>
