## Second Brain by Tiago Forte

Before reading this book, I was drowning in scattered notes. I had information everywhere, random .txt files, browser bookmarks, screenshots that I'd never find again. I knew I needed a better system, but I didn't know where to start.

That's when I discovered Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain." The concept was simple yet powerful: your brain shouldn't be a storage device, it should be a processing unit. You need an external system to capture, organize, and retrieve information when you need it.

I've been using Notion for the past 3-4 years, replacing my chaotic .txt files. It was a game-changer, and I learned so much about organizing information effectively. I experimented with different tools for reference materials, RemNote was for active learning with flashcards, and Apple Notes for quick capture.

But over time, I realized that having multiple tools was creating friction. I was spending more time deciding where to put information than actually capturing it. That's when I simplified everything.

Now, **Apple Notes** is my centralized second brain. Everything is there; reference materials, study notes, project documentation, and anything else I need to capture or remember. Having everything in one place means I can search across all my knowledge instantly, without context switching between apps. It's fast, always accessible across my phone, watch and laptop. It is surprisingly powerful once you learn to organize it well.

Instead of trying to remember everything, I can focus on understanding and creating, knowing that my second brain has my back.
