Working at Club Lanús has been an incredible experience that combines my passion for technology with the excitement of sports.

## How It Started

In 2024, I met Club Lanús president Luis Chebel and began collaborating with the club on its digital transformation initiatives.

## What I Do

In my current role, I work on various technical challenges that help improve the club's operations and fan experience. Some of the projects I've built include:

### Museo Granate

[Museo Granate](https://museogranate.com) is a digital platform that showcases the club's rich history and heritage.

### Club Lanús Help Center

The [Club Lanús Help Center](https://clublanus.help.center/) provides fans with easy access to information and support for their questions and needs.

### WhatsApp Chatbot

The [WhatsApp chatbot](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=%2B5491128420065&text&type=phone_number&app_absent=0) handles over 10,000 messages per month and helps fans with their questions, providing instant support and information.
