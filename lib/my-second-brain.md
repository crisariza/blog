excerpt: "How I organize my knowledge using Notion, RemNote, and Apple Notes"
---

I've using Notion for the past 3/4 years replacing .txt, it was a great move and I learn a lot.

Now my way of using this is like this:

- **Notion** for information that I don't need to remember, as a sort of a database that I can access anytime and make changes
- **RemNote** for information that I need to remember and study, so it's usuful for college, preparing interviews, learning languages, etc. The best tool that they have is image occlusion and flashcards
- **Apple Notes** this one is for notes on the go, that I need simple access and write down as fast as I can, some information that I write here I might migrate it to RemNote or Notion, I write here just to throw in the knowledge in a fast way
