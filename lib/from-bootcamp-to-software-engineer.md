excerpt: "My journey from learning to code to landing my first developer role"

My first structured coding path was at Henry Bootcamp, where I trust the program when it only had a few dozens of programmers per cohort (now they are the biggest coding bootcamp in LATAM).

## The Learning Journey

### Month 1: Algorithms and Data Structures

During the first month, I learned about Algorithms and Data Structures. This was similar to the first year of college in computer science and the common technical interview questions, like the ones in LeetCode. The module covered an introduction to computer science, advanced JavaScript concepts, data structures (arrays, objects, trees, graphs), algorithm design and analysis, and soft skills for developers.

### Month 2: Frontend Development

The second month was focused on frontend development. I learned the DOM, advanced CSS techniques, ES6 features, AJAX for asynchronous requests, and bundlers. The main focus was React - I learned React fundamentals, styling approaches, state management and lifecycle methods, routing, forms, Redux for global state management, React-Redux integration, and React Hooks.

### Month 3: Backend Development

The third month shifted to backend development. I learned Node.js fundamentals, how to build web servers, promises and advanced promise patterns, the Express.js framework for building REST APIs, async/await for cleaner asynchronous code, and testing methodologies.

### Month 4: Databases

The fourth month was all about databases. I learned about Database Management Systems (DBMS), SQL for querying and managing relational databases, and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like Sequelize.

## Putting It All Together

After all that theory and practice, it was time to put everything together. The first project came after finalizing the learning modules.

I built a countries web application that consumed a countries API and created a custom API using all the technologies I had learned. The project was a success and got good grades.

Then came my favorite part: the team project. I led a team of 5+ developers in building an e-commerce website as part of the bootcamp's final project. We implemented secure authentication, automated emails, payment integration, and search functionality. This was the best experience of the bootcamp, where I was able to demonstrate both my technical and leadership skills.

## The Outcome

After 4 months and nearly a thousand hours of intensive learning, the bootcamp finished and they shared my profile with Accenture.

I performed well in the interviews and landed my first software engineer job just 3 weeks after completing the bootcamp.
